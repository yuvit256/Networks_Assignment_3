# Networks_Assignment_3
## In this assignment we wrote two program files: Sender.c and Receiver.c. 
The Sender will send a file and the
Receiver will receive it and measure the time it took for his program to receive the file.
The file will be sent in two parts (first half and second half [Each half should be 50% of the file]) each
half will be sent according to one of the CC algorithms you learned in the lectures.
we were obligated to send the file a few times (at least 5 times in each run) for creating data set.
Now we need to run the program with a packet lost tool in the following levels:

+ 0% lost 
+ 10% lost
+ 15% lost
+ 20% lost
